---GENERAL NOTES---

    -Probably need to embed spotify player for better access to music data.
    -Alternative idea: somehow get sound data from the song via spotify and then populate some sort of gif or video based on that data
        -would need to figure out how to synch up the timing with the actual song because visual and audio would technically be separate.
